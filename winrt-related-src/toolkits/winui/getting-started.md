# Getting started with the Windows UI Library

The toolkit is available as NuGet packages that can be added to any existing or new project using Visual Studio.

## Download and install the Windows UI Library

1. Download [Visual Studio 2017](https://developer.microsoft.com/windows/downloads) and ensure you choose the **Universal Windows Platform development** Workload in the Visual Studio installer.

    > [!NOTE]
    Visual Studio 2015 doesn't support the Windows UI Library. 

2. Open an existing project, or create a new project using the Blank App template under Visual C# -> Windows -> Universal.  
    > **Important**:  To use the Windows UI Library, your projectâ€™s Min version must be 14393 or higher and the Target version must be 17134 or higher.   

3. In Solution Explorer panel, right click on your project name and select **Manage NuGet Packages**. Make sure **Include Prerelease** is checked and search for **Microsoft.UI.Xaml**, then choose which [Windows UI Library NuGet Packages](nuget-packages.md) you want to use.

4. Add the WinUI Theme Resources to your App.xaml resources. There are two ways to do this, depending on whether you have additional application resources. 

    a. If you don't have other application resources, 
    add `<XamlControlsResources xmlns="using:Microsoft.UI.Xaml.Controls"/>` to your Application.Resources: 

    ``` XAML
    <Application>
        <Application.Resources>
            <XamlControlsResources xmlns="using:Microsoft.UI.Xaml.Controls"/> 
        </Application.Resources>
    </Application>
    ```

    b. Otherwise, if you have more than one set of application resources, add `<XamlControlsResources xmlns="using:Microsoft.UI.Xaml.Controls"/>` to  Application.Resources.MergedDictionaries:

    ``` XAML
    <Application>
        <Application.Resources>
            <ResourceDictionary>
                <ResourceDictionary.MergedDictionaries>
                    <XamlControlsResources  xmlns="using:Microsoft.UI.Xaml.Controls"/>
                </ResourceDictionary.MergedDictionaries> 
            </ResourceDictionary>
        </Application.Resources>
    </Application>
    ```



5. Add a reference to the toolkit to XAML pages and your code-behind pages:

    * In your XAML page, add a reference at the top of your page

        ```xaml
        xmlns:controls="using:Microsoft.UI.Xaml.Controls"
        ```

    * In your code, add the toolkit's namespace: 

        ```c#
        using MUXC = Microsoft.UI.Xaml.Controls;
        ```
