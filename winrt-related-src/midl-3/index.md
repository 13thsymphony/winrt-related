# Microsoft Interface Definition Language 3.0 reference
Microsoft Interface Definition Language (MIDL) 3.0 is a simplified, modern, familiar syntax for declaring Windows Runtime types inside Interface Definition Language (`.idl`) files.

```idl
// BookSku.idl
namespace Bookstore
{
    runtimeclass BookSku
    {
        String Title;
    }
}
```

As of version 10.0.17134.0 (Windows 10, version 1803), the Windows SDK includes command-line support for MIDL 3.0 (`midl.exe` version 8.01.0622 or later, used with the `/winrt` switch).
