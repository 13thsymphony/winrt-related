# winrt::make_self function template (C++/WinRT)

A factory method that returns a [com_ptr](com-ptr.md) to an instance of the implementation type for a runtime class. For an explanation of the implementation type and projected type concepts, see [Implementation and projected types for a C++/WinRT runtime class](/windows/uwp/cpp-and-winrt-apis/ctors-runtimeclass-activation?branch=live). Also see [make](make.md).

If you're authoring a runtime class then, from within the same compilation unit, you can use **make_self** to construct an instance of the implementation type for the runtime class. Assign the return value from **make_self** to a [com_ptr](com-ptr.md) of your implementation type so that you manage the lifetime of the object appropriately.

## Syntax
```cppwinrt
template <typename D, typename... Args>
auto make_self(Args&&... args)
```

### Template parameters
`typename D`
The implementation type for a runtime class.

### Parameters
`args`
Any constructor arguments for the constructor being invoked.

### Return value 
A [com_ptr](com-ptr.md) to a newly-created instance of the implementation type for the runtime class.

## Requirements
**Minimum supported SDK:** Windows SDK for Windows 10, version 1803

**Namespace:** winrt

**Header** %ProgramFiles(x86)%\Windows Kits\10\Include\<WindowsTargetPlatformVersion>\cppwinrt\winrt\base.h (included by default)
