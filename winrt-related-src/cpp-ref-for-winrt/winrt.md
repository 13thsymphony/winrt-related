# winrt namespace (C++/WinRT)
> [!NOTE]
> **Some information relates to pre-released product which may be substantially modified before itâ€™s commercially released. Microsoft makes no warranties, express or implied, with respect to the information provided here.**

The **winrt** namespace provides custom data types belonging to C++/WinRT&mdash;the [standard C++ language projection for Windows Runtime (WinRT) APIs](/windows/uwp/cpp-and-winrt-apis/index?branch=live). These custom types provide appropriate conversions to and from standard types so that, much of the time, you can continue to use the standard C++ language features that you're accustomed to using, and the source code that you already have.

Also provided in the **winrt** namespace are functions (for creating runtime class instances, boxing and unboxing, etc.), smart pointers, and other facilities.

## Types
| Type | Description |
| - | - |
| [array_view struct template](array-view.md) | A view, or span, of a contiguous series of values. |
| [box_value function template](box-value.md) | A function template that wraps (or *boxes*) a scalar value inside a reference class object so that it can be passed to a function that expects **IInspectable**. |
| [com_array struct template](com-array.md) | A view, or span, of a contiguous series of values for passing to and from WinRT APIs. |
| [com_ptr struct template](com-ptr.md) | A reference-counted COM smart pointer template. |
| [hstring struct](hstring.md) | A sequential collection of UTF-16 Unicode characters representing a text string. |
| [make function template](make.md) | A factory method that returns an instance of the projected type for a runtime class when parameterized with the corresponding implementation type. |
| [make_self function template](make-self.md) | A factory method that returns a [com_ptr](com-ptr.md) to an instance of the implementation type for a runtime class. |
| [unbox_value function template](unbox-value.md) | A function template that unwraps (or *unboxes*) a scalar value from inside a reference class object so that it can be processed in a function that expects **IInspectable**. |
| [unbox_value_or function template](unbox-value-or.md) | A function template that unwraps (or *unboxes*) a scalar value from inside a reference class object, with a fallback value, so that it can be processed in a function that expects **IInspectable**. |
