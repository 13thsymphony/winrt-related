# winrt namespace ([C++/WinRT](/windows/uwp/cpp-and-winrt-apis/intro-to-using-cpp-with-winrt))
The **winrt** namespace provides custom data types belonging to [C++/WinRT](/windows/uwp/cpp-and-winrt-apis/index)&mdash;the standard, modern C++17 language projection for Windows Runtime (WinRT) APIs. These custom types provide appropriate conversions to and from standard types so that, much of the time, you can continue to use the standard C++ language features that you're accustomed to using, and the source code that you already have.

Also provided in the **winrt** namespace are functions (for creating runtime class instances, boxing and unboxing, etc.), smart pointers, and other facilities.

## Types
| Type | Description |
| - | - |
| [agile_ref struct template](agile-ref.md) | A type representing an agile reference to a C++/WinRT object or interface. |
| [array_view struct template](array-view.md) | A view, or span, of a contiguous series of values. |
| [attach_abi function](attach-abi.md) | A helper function that attaches a C++/WinRT object to a handle, or to a raw pointer that owns a reference to its target. |
| [auto_revoke_t marker struct](auto-revoke-t.md) | A marker type used to request an event revoker when registering a delegate to handle an event. |
| [box_value function template](box-value.md) | A function template that wraps (or *boxes*) a scalar value inside a reference class object so that it can be passed to a function that expects **IInspectable**. |
| [com_array struct template](com-array.md) | A view, or span, of a contiguous series of values for passing to and from Windows Runtime APIs. |
| [com_ptr struct template](com-ptr.md) | A reference-counted COM smart pointer template. |
| [copy_from_abi function](copy-from-abi.md) | A helper function that copies to a C++/WinRT object from a handle, or from a raw pointer. |
| [copy_to_abi function](copy-to-abi.md) | A helper function that copies to a handle, or to a pointer from a C++/WinRT object. |
| [delegate struct template](delegate.md) | A type that you can use to declare a custom delegate type for your own events. |
| [detach_abi function](detach-abi.md) | A helper function that detaches a C++/WinRT object from its referenced handle, or from its referenced interface. |
| [event struct template](event.md) | A type that you can use to declare and implement an event of a specified delegate type. |
| [event_token struct](event-token.md) | A token returned when registering an event-handling delegate with an event; can be used to revoke the registration of the same delegate. |
| [from_abi function template](from-abi.md) | A helper function that, given a projected interface object, retrieves a pointer to the implementation. |
| [get_abi function](get-abi.md) | A helper function that retrieves a pointer to a C++/WinRT object's underlying [IUnknown interface](https://msdn.microsoft.com/library/windows/desktop/ms680509). |
| [hstring struct](hstring.md) | A sequential collection of UTF-16 Unicode characters representing a text string. |
| [implements struct template](implements.md) | A base struct template that implements one or more Windows Runtime interfaces on behalf of a derived type. |
| [make function template](make.md) | A factory method that returns an instance of a projected type or interface when parameterized with the corresponding implementation type. |
| [make_agile function template](make-agile.md) | A helper function that returns an [agile_ref](agile-ref.md) object, representing an agile reference to a C++/WinRT object or interface. |
| [make_self function template](make-self.md) | A factory method that returns a [com_ptr](com-ptr.md) to an instance of the implementation type for a runtime class. |
| [make_weak function template](make-weak.md) | A helper function that returns a [weak_ref](weak-ref.md) object, representing a weak reference to a C++/WinRT object or interface. |
| [no_weak_ref marker struct](no-weak-ref.md) | A marker type used to opt out of weak reference support. |
| [non_agile marker struct](non-agile.md) | A marker type used to indicate that your type is not agile, and consequently does not implement the [IAgileObject interface](https://msdn.microsoft.com/library/windows/desktop/hh802476). |
| [put_abi function](put-abi.md) | A helper function that retrieves the address of a C++/WinRT object's underlying IUnknown interface pointer so that it can be set to another value. |
| [swap function](swap.md) | A helper function that swaps the contents of two values. |
| [unbox_value function template](unbox-value.md) | A function template that unwraps (or *unboxes*) a scalar value from inside a reference class object so that it can be processed in a function that expects **IInspectable**. |
| [unbox_value_or function template](unbox-value-or.md) | A function template that unwraps (or *unboxes*) a scalar value from inside a reference class object, with a fallback value, so that it can be processed in a function that expects **IInspectable**. |
| [weak_ref struct template](weak-ref.md) | A type representing a weak reference to a C++/WinRT object or interface. |
| [Windows::Foundation::IUnknown struct](windows-foundation-iunknown.md) | Every C++/WinRT runtime class (whether a Windows or a third party runtime class) derives from winrt::Windows::Foundation::IUnknown. |
| [xaml_typename function template](xaml-typename.md) | A helper function that returns the type name of a Windows Runtime type, in the form of a [Windows::UI::Xaml::Interop::TypeName](/uwp/api/windows.ui.xaml.interop.typename) object. |
