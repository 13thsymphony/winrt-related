# Schema for Mobile Broadband


## Purpose


The Mobile Broadband Schema are used by the [**Windows.Networking.NetworkOperators**](https://msdn.microsoft.com/library/windows/apps/br241148) namespace provided in the Windows Runtime environment to enable a Windows Store app to provision a mobile broadband enabled device on a mobile broadband network, query subscriber data usage information, or query the results of the last provisioning attempt.

The Mobile Broadband Schema define subscriber and network configuration parameters. They contain the subscriber preferences for a connection as well as subscriber data usage information.

The Mobile Broadband Schema strictly enforces the order of the nodes. Nodes used by the [**Windows.Networking.NetworkOperators**](https://msdn.microsoft.com/library/windows/apps/br241148) namespace must adhere to the Mobile Broadband Schema and appear in the order prescribed in the schema definition.
