# StoreManifest schema (Windows 8.1 and earlier)


StoreManifest.xml is an optional configuration file that may be included in the package of UWP app packages. Its purpose is to enable features, such as declaring your app as a Microsoft Store device app, that the AppxManifest.xml file does not cover. StoreManifest.xml is submitted with the application package and must be in the root folder of your app's main project.

**Note**  This section describes StoreManifest.xml for packages targeting Windows 8.1 and earlier. For Windows 10, see [StoreManifest schema](https://msdn.microsoft.com/library/windows/apps/mt617335).

 

To validate your StoreManifest.xml, create a new xml document in Microsoft Visual Studio and add the following declaration:

`http://schemas.microsoft.com/appx/2010/StoreManifest namespace`

See the samples instance document in [StoreManifest XML example (Windows 8.1 and earlier)](https://msdn.microsoft.com/library/windows/apps/jj730527).

The following table lists all of the elements in this schema, sorted alphabetically by name.
